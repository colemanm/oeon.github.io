**tl;dr** *Infrared Interpretation: a rapid and very effective use of technology to gather data & intelligence for delivery of a quality product to wildfire incident managers.*

I've been on a heck of a run, doing Infrared Interpreter assignments this month - 14 days...well, make that **nights**. Most days average around 16 hours long..so bear with my wackiness, I'll try to catch-up on some sleep! [IRIN](http://www.nationalfiretraining.net/catalog/detail/code/S443) is a position within the Incident Command System (ICS) for wildfire incidents. I was exposed to it as a [GIS Specialist for Incident Management](http://www.nationalfiretraining.net/catalog/detail/code/S341) (GISS) and attracted to how it combines rapid intelligence and mapping - and all their surrounding associated technologies.

When an incident (typically wildfire) needs a resource (like IRIN), the resource status and availability is queried/ordered in [ROSS](http://ross.nwcg.gov/aboutross.html). Then, under direction of the National Infrared Operations [NIROPS](http://nirops.fs.fed.us/pages/about) Unit - IRIN's around the Western U.S. work by coordination of a National Coordinator. I pilfered [this](http://www.wrightwoodfsc.com/StationFire/NIROPS_Poster_Jan2008.pdf) description:

>At PL 4, a National IR Coordinator takes over the infrared operations from
>the aviation desk at NICC. This includes receiving the scanner order 
>requests, making sure there are IRINs assigned to each incident, prioritizing 
>the flights according to NMAC, planning the missions with the crews, flight
>following, trouble-shooting along the flight, remote data uploads, acquiring
>other resources and reporting accomplishments back to NICC.  

Acronyms they don't teach you in the bike lane
 
- [PL][0]: The five Preparedness Levels range from I to V, with V being the highest level.   
- [NICC][1]: National Interagency Coordination Center 

Orders come in for the various [active incidents](http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/) ongoing - a flight plan is developed for the operational assests available to NIROPS - and IRIN's are assigned to one or more fires.

*My workflow as an IRIN*: download support data from the incident including most recent fire perimeter, fire line types, organizational work assignment locations (Divisions, Branches, etc.), review the weather. Following the airplanes with [AFF](https://www.aff.gov/) and the pilots via Twitter - I know when my fire has been flown and [the data](http://nirops.fs.fed.us/pages/imagery) is complete for download & interpretation. Based upon the data, I interpret and adjust the previously know heat perimeter and categorize various types of heat. I generate a few .PDF map products, 4 shapefiles: isolated heat points & scattered/intense and heat perimeter polygons, a .KMZ and a mission log - and return the goods to the incident.
