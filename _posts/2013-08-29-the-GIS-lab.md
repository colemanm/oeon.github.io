**tl;dr** *--*

In May of 2009, my boss and I both transitioned into new positions and began a new GIS collaboration - for the sake of this post, let's called it 'The GIS lab'. My goal with this collection of words is to document some of the progress, development and future plans of *the lab*.

### Origins

**Dumpster diving**, we actually salvaged a couple servers from the trash and upgraded the hard drives. They're something like HP Proliants, immediately I had someone help me setup Debian on itâ€¦we still haven't managed to break the things using them for our main disk storage (SAMBA to Windows as network drive).

**OpenStreetMap** was how I met Corey as he was beginning his Software Engineering undergrad. We began to realize the old HP Proliants weren't cutting it and went with Amazon EC2 and S3.
