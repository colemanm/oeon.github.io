Hi, my name is Joe and I'm a tinkerer / mapper - this is my simple homepage.

**Bio**: Joe is a GIS/mapping professional located on the Central Coast of California. He has bachelor's degree from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo and a background in Forestry, Wildland Fire, and GIS. His journey down the rabbit hole began with his Dad bringing home a GPS unit and remarking on the potential of the technology, and his love for cartography grew after staring for hours at USGS topographic maps. He is continuing to expand his horizons by becoming adept at programming, web development, and databases. He would not be where he is today if not for such a friendly and generous open source geospatial community. Outside of work, Joe enjoys traveling, camping, and hiking - with three summits of Mount Whitney under his belt.
